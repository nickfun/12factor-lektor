      <h2>I. Codebase</h2>

      <h3>One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys</h3>
	
      <p>A twelve-factor app is always tracked in a version control system, such as <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>, or <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>.  A copy of the revision tracking database is known as a <em>code repository</em>, often shortened to <em>code repo</em> or just <em>repo</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>codebase</em> is any single repo (in a centralized revision control system like Subversion), or any set of repos who share a root commit (in a decentralized revision control system like Git).</p>
<p><img src="../images/codebase-deploys.png" alt="One codebase maps to many deploys"></p>
<p>There is always a one-to-one correlation between the codebase and the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are multiple codebases, it's not an app -- it's a distributed system.  Each component in a distributed system is an app, and each can individually comply with twelve-factor.</li>
<li>Multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of twelve-factor.  The solution here is to factor shared code into libraries which can be included through the <a href="../01-codebase/dependencies">dependency manager</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is only one codebase per app, but there will be many deploys of the app.  A <em>deploy</em> is a running instance of the app.  This is typically a production site, and one or more staging sites.  Additionally, every developer has a copy of the app running in their local development environment, each of which also qualifies as a deploy.</p>
<p>The codebase is the same across all deploys, although different versions may be active in each deploy.  For example, a developer has some commits not yet deployed to staging; staging has some commits not yet deployed to production.  But they all share the same codebase, thus making them identifiable as different deploys of the same app.</p>
