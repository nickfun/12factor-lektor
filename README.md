# 12factor-lektor

Reimplent the [12factor website](https://github.com/heroku/12factor) in [Lektor](https://github.com/lektor/lektor).

## Goals

- understand the lektor system.
- use freely avaiable content to populate a static site while learning it.
- 12 factor has many translations, so I can learn the lektor "Alternatives" system to implement that too.
- The 12 factor app guidelines are great and should be read again :)

## Notes

You need Lektor master branch or Lektor 2.0 to build this project.
