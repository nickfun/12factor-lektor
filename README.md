# 12factor-lektor

Reimplent the [12factor website](https://github.com/heroku/12factor) in [Lektor](https://github.com/lektor/lektor).

## Goals

- understand the lektor system.
- use freely avaiable content to populate a static site while learning it.
- 12 factor has many translations, so I can learn the lektor "Alternatives" system to implement that too.
- The 12 factor app guidelines are great and should be read again :)

## Notes

Currently building with Lektor v2.3

## On github pages

- http://nickfun.github.io/12factor-lektor
- use `build-for-gh.sh` to have lektor build the site and output to `/docs`
